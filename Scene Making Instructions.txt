* BUYABLE ITEMS *
-All the PN buyable items starts with "pn_buy_" name.

* SHIPS *
-All the controllable ships starts with "pn_ship_" name. Don't use the names that ends with "cd", 
	"sail" or "sail_off".
-There are two types of NW ships: With Ramp and normal. Those with ramp has "with_ramp" on its name. 
	When placing those with ramp, do tests to see where the ramp you start (Because, frigate 
	is so huge, that you will need to place it on the side of a plataform).
-All the cannons, except "mm_cannon_12pdr" and "mm_cannon_howitzer" can be used on ships. You are
	limited to place at maximum 9 cannon/rockets per ship. To attach the cannons on ships you 
	need to see the same Var 2 as for each other (ship and cannon).
	Ex: If you assign 4 in Var 2 for the ship the cannon needs to be 4 also. WARNING: Aways 
	test if the cannnon is attached right or if it's moving right with the ship!
-Set the Z position (altitude) to 0, else they will bug on reset.

* CANNONS *
-Do not use the cannons that has "wood", "limber", "wheel", "barrel" or "plataform" on name. Use 
	the normal cannons (with the complete set of equipaments: Limber, Wheels, etc).
-There's a very boring bug which makes a tiny barrier in front of a "Mortar" placed on scene. So,
	make tests to check if it will cause problems.

* HORSES *
-Horses that has "Artellery" in name spawns with cannons. So, don't place them like they are
	normal horses.

* TREES *
-All the trees that are usable (player can cut down) starts with "mm_tree_" name and DOESN'T has
	"_vegetation" on name. The trees that has vegetation on name aren't usable!

* BEELS *
-To place an usable bell use the bell's rope Scene Prop. It's the rope that will make the sound, not 
	the bell.

* HOUSES *
-Houses that are complete (comes with walls, roof and floor), DOESN'T spawn with windows! You need
	to place it manually.
-The Scene Props that starts with "mm_house_wall_*" on name, wich has a space for window, starts with
 	window Automatically. So DO NOT place window on it. Except those that has "d", "dd" or 
	"ddd" on name.
-For manually adding windows you can use the Var no 1, of the scene obj. By using you it you can 
place various types of window, wich are: 1 = Rich type glass 
			                 2 = Broken normal type glass
                                         3 = Broken rich type glass
            			         4 = Don't spawn any window
