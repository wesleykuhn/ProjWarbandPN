Welcome to the Napoleonic Sourcecode package! :)


Installer Files:
The folder includes all you need to set up an installer for your Napoleonic Wars mod.
For simple instructions on how to set it up, see the "Installer Readme" included in the folder.

Remember that you are not allowed to backport (transfer) any Napoleonic Wars expansion content (including, but not limited to, Models, Textures, Scripts, Shaders, Sounds)
to Mount & Blade: Warband or Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword unless you add a CD Key check for the Napoleonic Wars CD key in your mod installer.
The installer script provided does this for you, so you do not have to worry about this if you use it.


Sourcecode:
The folder includes source codes for Napoleonic Wars:
"mm dev - MS" contains the latest released Module System for Napoleonic Wars - at the time of writing this is 1.200. Main compiler is "build_module.bat".
"Shaders" contains the shader sourcecode. Compile it with "compile_fx.bat".
"Module_data 1.134" contains the flora and skybox data. Main compiler is "build_all.bat".



Happy modding!
