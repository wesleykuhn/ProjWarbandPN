# Merchants #
-They Can't be killed. 
-Verify if exists the entry_point number 5 before call this.
-Their calling show be something like: (add_visitors_to_current_scene, 5,"trp_merchant_bot", 1, team_spawn_invulnerable, -1).
-The number '1' is the amount of bots. If you create more than one they will start side by side. You can create a way to take all 
agents, check if they are 'trp_merchant_bot' and move them, using (agent_set_position,*). 
Where '5' is the spawn entry point target. This entry point needs to be on a far place, where players will trade with those bots. 
-This trade is sample. Just put the 'pw_export_*' stuff on front of those merchants. 
-Also, call diferent standing animations to those. Their clothes should be like foreigns.

-This should be an event, called in 20-20 minutes, with only 40% of chance to happen.
-Use (entry_point_get_position, pos2, 6). Where '6' is the entry point for those.
-Then use (set_spawn_position, pos2).
-And finnaly (spawn_agent,"trp_*"). Where the 'trp_*' is the troop for it, also can be random.
-Should be spawn between 3-7.
-They can only have a main weapon.
-When dead, they can drop between 700-6000 gold.
